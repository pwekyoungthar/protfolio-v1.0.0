// Sticky Navigation
const sectionHeroEl = document.querySelector(".section-hero");
const obs = new IntersectionObserver(
  function (entries) {
    const ent = entries[0];
    console.log(ent);
    if (ent.isIntersecting === false) {
      document.body.classList.add("sticky");
    }
    if (ent.isIntersecting === true) {
      document.body.classList.remove("sticky");
    }
  },
  {
    // In The View Port
    root: null,
    threshold: 0,
    rootMargin: "-80px",
  }
);
obs.observe(sectionHeroEl);

Noted =>
sitcky class will be put in body element 
So you will be create .sticky .header as a new one 


// Fixing flexbox gap property missing in some Safari versions
function checkFlexGap() {
  var flex = document.createElement("div");
  flex.style.display = "flex";
  flex.style.flexDirection = "column";
  flex.style.rowGap = "1px";

  flex.appendChild(document.createElement("div"));
  flex.appendChild(document.createElement("div"));

  document.body.appendChild(flex);
  var isSupported = flex.scrollHeight === 1;
  flex.parentNode.removeChild(flex);
  console.log(isSupported);

  if (!isSupported) document.body.classList.add("no-flexbox-gap");
}
checkFlexGap();


Scroll Animation
-----------------
CSS : in html selector =>	scroll-behavior: smooth;

JS : 
const allLinks = document.querySelectorAll("a:link");

allLinks.forEach(function (link) {
  link.addEventListener("click", function (e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const href = link.getAttribute("href");
    if (href === "#") {
      window.scrollTo({
        top: 0,
        behavior: "smooth",
      });
    }
    if (href !== "#" && href.startsWith("#")) {
      const selectEl = document.querySelector(href);
      selectEl.scrollIntoView({
        behavior: "smooth",
      });
    }
  });
});
